# Tested devices
Contains lists of PC systems that I installed pfsense on 

# pfsense x64 on All-in-one/Dual NIC devices
- Datto 1000 : dual NIC built in 
- Dell OptiPlex XE SFF (c2d e7400 2.8Ghz/8GB DDR3)

# pfsense x64 with Network Cards
- HP thin client t610
- HP thin client t610 plus
- HP Elite 8300
- Dell Optiplex XE


# pfsense x86 on All in one device
- MSI/Smartvue WindBOX II Ms-9a25 : Dual NIC built in

# Lan Cards/chips 
1. Broadcom 5709 | net extream 2 => Very good performance 
2. Broadcom built in t610 > Very good 
3. Realtek Built in Datto 1000 > not so good : 
  - Good when all set up
  - not Good when I apply new settings or rules. It works slow and need to reboot several times. 
4. Realtek Built in Ms-9a25 > it is slow for a device but works smoodth.  

# A better Approach for regular use
- See compatibility lists of LAN cards with pfsense (freeBSD)
- See Hardware requirements , a old XEON (before 2012) will be cheaper. Use ebay for better price. 

# For Home use or learning 
- Thin clents are cheap and conveninet for home learning.
- If you are want to use as main router, better you need to have backup unit.

# Recommendations :
- Dell OptiPlex XE SFF (c2d e7400 2.8Ghz/8GB DDR3), its broadcom chip , so better performing in a small package.
